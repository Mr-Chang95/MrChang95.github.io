													Employee Predictions with Naive-Bayes & Linear Regression in R</a>
												</h3>
												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic11.png" alt="" /></span>

												<p>DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. 
													Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, 
													identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its 
													competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting 
													employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management.
												</p>

												<h4>PROJECT INFORMATION</h4>
												<p>In this project, I will identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover (backed up by evidence provided by analysis). 
													The business is also interested in learning about any job role specific trends that may exist in the data set. You can also provide 
													any other interesting trends and observations from your analysis. The analysis is backed up by robust experimentation and appropriate 
													visualization.
												</p>

												<p>There are two goals to this project. First, we want to find factors that lead to attrition and determine monthly income with EDA.
													Secondly , we want to build two prediction models with our chosen factors that can accurately predict both of the variables mentioned
													above. Lastly, we want to use our model to predict the value of these variables on 2 different test datasets. The two models that we 
													found work best are the Naive-Bayes model for attrition and Linear Regression model for salary. We also tried the KNN model. Additionally,
													a video presentation was also made to address our findings.

												Home Sale Price Prediction with SAS & R</a>
											</h3>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic12.png" alt="Scatter Plot" /></span>

											<p>Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the 
												proximity to an east-west railroad. But this Kaggle competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations 
												than the number of bedrooms or the presence of a white-picket fence! With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect 
												of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home. The entire process will 
												be done in R and SAS. SAS is used for the first analysis question and variable selection.
											</p>

											<h4>PROJECT INFORMATION</h4>
											<p><strong>Analysis 1:</strong> Century 21 Ames only sells houses in the NAmes, Edwards and BrkSide neighborhoods and would like to simply get 
												an estimate of how the SalePrice of the house is related to the square footage of the living area of the house (GrLIvArea) and if the SalesPrice
												(and its relationship to square footage) depends on which neighborhood the house is located in. Build and fit a model that will answer this question, 
												keeping in mind that realtors prefer to talk about living area in increments of 100 sq. ft. Provide your client with the estimate (or estimates if it v
												aries by neighborhood) as well as confidence intervals for any estimate(s).<br>
												For this analysis, we also want to create to make an RShiny app that will display at least display a scatterplot of price of the home v. square 
												footage (GrLivArea) and allow for the plot to be displayed for at least the NAmes, Edwards and BrkSide neighborhoods separately.
											</p>

											<p><strong>Analysis 2: </strong> Build the most predictive model for sales prices of homes in all of Ames Iowa. This includes all neighborhoods. 
												Your group is limited to only the techniques we have learned in 6371 (no random forests or other methods we have not yet covered). 
												Specifically, you should produce 4 models: one from forward selection, one from backwards elimination, one from stepwise selection, and 
												one that you build custom. The custom model could be one of the three preceding models or one that you build by adding or subtracting variables 
												at your will. Generate an adjusted R-Squared, CV Press and Kaggle Score for each of these models and clearly describe which model you feel is the
												best in terms of being able to predict future sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa. We will use all 4 our models to predict the Saleprice on a test 
												dataset(test.csv). <br>
												In the end, we want to write a 7 page report discussing our findings along with an appendix that includes all of our codes.

											<h4>PROJECT INFORMATION</h4>
											<p><ul class="divided">
												<li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong></li>

													users.</li>
												<li><strong>Matrix Factorization:</strong> For the final step, I created a machine learning approach to building recommendations.

											<h4>PROJECT INFORMATION</h4>
											<p> In this project, I will create a machine learning/NLP pipeline to categorize these events and build a model to classify messages that 
												are sent during disasters. There are 36 pre-defined categories, and examples of these categories include Aid Related, Medical Help, 
												Search And Rescue, etc. By classifying these messages, we can allow these messages to be sent to the appropriate disaster relief agency. 
												The dataset -provided by Figure Eight- is used to build a model that classifies disaster messages, while the web app is where a respondent 
												can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.
												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic16.png" alt="Data Pipeline Dashboard" /></span>

											</h3>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic17.png" alt="STable of Models" /></span>
											
											<h4>PROJECT INFORMATION</h4>
											<p> Starbucks, one of the world’s most popular coffee shops, frequently provides offers to its customers through its rewards 
												app to drive more sales. These offers can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or 
												BOGO (buy one get one free).
												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic18.png" alt="Violin Plot: Income" /></span>
												The goal of this project is to find some factors and build a machine learning(ML) that predicts what makes a customer 
												complete an offer(regardless of the offer type). I am mostly interested in the demographics as I believe that they are bigger 
												factors than the offer types.
												<p>Firstly, to best analyze the data thoroughly, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is performed to find the data representations & 
													characteristics. In this step, I will get to know the data better, as well as clean it. Secondly, with the data provided, I 
													will answer the above questions with the help of charts and various ML models which will be fed the data from a merged dataset 
													which consists of the following: portfolio, profile, transactional. </p>
