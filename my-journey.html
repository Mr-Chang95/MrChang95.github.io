													<p class="pic_pad">Hello! My name is Daniel Lu Chang. I was born in Long Island, New York and
														currently reside in the Bay Area. My Data Science journey began as a History undergraduate
														at UC Santa Barbara where I discovered the process of EDA and how I can use data to support 
														and strengthen my arguments. I am currently attending Southern Methodist University to further my education. 
														During my leisure time, I love to read and play basketball. My favorite NBA team is the Lakers!

														<h2>Welcome to My Data Story!</h2>
														<p>Learn about how I got my start in data science!</p>
													</header>

													<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08_1.jpg" alt="SMU DS, Class of 2024" /></span>

													<p>I am currently a Data Science graduate student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.
														I am part of the 2024 class and have met many diligent students who share the same interest as me. Not
														only did I have the privlege of having these wonderful people as classmates, some have become very good friends of mine.
														Being a part of this cohort has been an eye-opener for me as I learn increasingly advanced statistical
														methods to apply to the data science field. During this time, I learned how to create better models to gain
														to gain insights and make predictions from data.
													</p>

													<h3>How did all this start?</h3>
													<p>As a History undergraduate, I always thought that I was going to become a professor specializing in American
														History. That is until I discovered the process of Exploratory Data Analysis in 2021 during the pandemic. I was 
														intrigued with the process and how I can obtain useful information from it. I was able to utilize what I've learned via
														Youtube to scrap data from various websites with the BeautifulSoup package in Python and support my thesis on radical attacks 
														within the modern European Union. Such data includes migration pattern, poverty rate per year, unemployment levels and more.
														By the time I graduated, my interest in data became obsessive which lead me to sign up got courses at
														<a href="https://www.udacity.com/" style="color: blue">Udacity</a> where I learned the basic of data modeling, engineering and
														dashboard creation.
													</p>

													<p>At <a href="https://www.stiddle.com/" style="color: blue">Stiddle</a> as a Marketing Consultant, I create gather, clean & analyze data to create
														create visualizations with the goal of presenting actionable insights to the executive team. Moreover, I've had the oppurtunity to 
														create a NLP pipeline to extract, transform and load data for analysis to determine the type of content to put out. Since then, I've only become increasingly obsessed with the field
														and plan focus on Natural Language Processing, more specifically Speech Recognition.Though I was a History major, I took many math classes as an undergraduate 
														-such as Linear Algerbra and Vector Calculus- and wanted to put these knowledge to good use. As a result, I 
														decided to enroll in SMU Data Science program where I furthered my understanding and knowledge in statistcs with concepts such as simple & multiple linear 
														regression with SAS & R. As I continue to learn more, I plan on applying what I've learned to every aspect of my professional life.

												<p>By classifying these messages, we can allow these messages to be sent to the appropriate disaster
