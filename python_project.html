                                                <p>This project was designed to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, 
                                                    and make recommendations to them about new articles that they might be interested in.

                                                    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong></li>
                                                    <li><strong>Rank Based Recommendations:</strong> Here, I begin by finding the most popular articles based on the most interactions. 
                                                        These articles are the ones that we might recommend to new users.</li>
                                                    <li><strong>User-User Based Collaborative Filtering:</strong> In order to give better recommendations to the users of IBM's platform, 
                                                        I examine users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to similar 
                                                        users.</li>
                                                    <li><strong>Matrix Factorization:</strong> For the final step, I created a machine learning approach to building recommendations. 
                                                        Using the user-item interactions, I built out a matrix decomposition which helps me in predicting new articles an individual might interact

                                                <p> In this project, I will create a machine learning/NLP pipeline to categorize these events and build a model to classify messages that 
                                                    are sent during disasters. There are 36 pre-defined categories, and examples of these categories include Aid Related, Medical Help, 
                                                    Search And Rescue, etc. By classifying these messages, we can allow these messages to be sent to the appropriate disaster relief agency. 
                                                    The dataset -provided by Figure Eight- is used to build a model that classifies disaster messages, while the web app is where a respondent 
                                                    can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.

                                                    Finally, this project also contains a web app that allows you to input a message and get classification results.

                                                <p> Starbucks, one of the worldâ€™s most popular coffee shops, frequently provides offers to its customers through its rewards 
                                                    app to drive more sales. These offers can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or 
                                                    BOGO (buy one get one free).

                                                    The goal of this project is to find some factors and build a machine learning(ML) that predicts what makes a customer 
                                                    complete an offer(regardless of the offer type). I am mostly interested in the demographics as I believe that they are bigger 
                                                    factors than the offer types.
                                                    <p>Firstly, to best analyze the data thoroughly, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is performed to find the data representations & 
                                                        characteristics. In this step, I will get to know the data better, as well as clean it. Secondly, with the data provided, I 
                                                        will answer the above questions with the help of charts and various ML models which will be fed the data from a merged dataset 
                                                        which consists of the following: portfolio, profile, transactional. </p>

                                                    <p>In this project, I am interested in working to understand the crime rate in London, England. My goal is to work through this notebook to 
                                                        understand violent crime rates and when they are likely to occur throughout the year. This dataset contains all crimes (non-violent and 
                                                        violent) committed between 2008 and 2016. However, the nature of the crime-violent or non-violent- is not specified in this dataset, so 
                                                        we will need to deal with that during the preprocessing phase. We will also need to specify which months are the ones when daylight saving 
                                                        is in effect.

                                                    <h4>Project Information</h4>
                                                    <p>There are a total of 2 notebooks dedicated to this project. This first notebook(London Crime Hypothesis Testing.ipynb) is dedicated to testing 
                                                        the individual factors(borough/location & daylight saving) that I think may affect the violent crime rate while the second 
                                                        notebook(London Crime Hypothesis Testing Part II.ipynb) to testing the interactions between location/borough and daylight saving for any 
                                                        significant effect on the rate.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        My initial assumption is that violent crime rates increase when daylight saving is not in effect, which means that the night is longer. Therefore, our hypothesises are:
                                                        <ul class="style2">
                                                        <li>Null Hypothesis: The difference between the violent crime rates when daylight saving is and isn't in effect is less than or equal to 0.</li>

                                                        <li>Alternative Hypothesis: The difference between the violent crime rates when daylight saving is and isn't in effect is greater than 0.</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                </p>

                                                    <p>For this project, I am mainly interested in conducting data exploration and analysis on the offensive stats and characteristics of 
                                                        different NBA teams between 1980 and 2021  based on Finals ranking which is a new column I will create that contains 4 values: Champion, Runner-Up, 
                                                        Knocked Out and Never Qualified. Knocked Out and Never Qualified implies that they have either been knocked out of or never qualified 
                                                        for the NBA playoffs. Some stats that you will see me analyze and visualize are Margin of Victory(MOV), 3P%, Age and shot attempts.

                                                        I scraped a total of 4 different stats tables from the website and stored them in 4 different datasets. In this notebook, I used 
                                                        3 different packages: Pandas, BeautifulSoup and Requests.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        I will then clean the data. Some steps I took here are dealing with null values, dropping unneeded columns, converting datatypes and 
                                                        cleaning up the values. After cleaning up the data, I merged 4 of the datasets into 2. I have also created a new column to indicate 
                                                        the NBA teams' Finals ranking in this notebook. One consists of the teams' total stats per year and one consists of the average stats 
                                                        per game for each year. In this notebook, I used 2 different packages: Pandas and Numpy.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic10.png" alt="" /></span>
                                                    <p>Lastly, I will analyze and create some visualizations of the stats. I started off by analyzing the total stats first to get a broad picture 
                                                        view by conducting and creating visuals for univariate and bivariate exploration. Afterward, I moved onto the average stats per game of 
                                                        each year where I conducted the same type of explorations along with multivariate exploration. You will find that I have also created a couple 
                                                        categorical variables for my analysis as well. In this notebook, I used 5 different packages: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Warnings. 
                                                        You will find the majority of the multivariate exploration near the end and a lengthy conclusion.
                                                    </p>

												reading, writing and math. Some of the models I'll try out are SVM, Random Forest, and KNN. Addtionally, I will also get my hands dirty with clustering.
