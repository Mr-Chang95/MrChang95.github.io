                                                <p>DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. 
                                                    Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, 
                                                    identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its 
                                                    competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting 
                                                    employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management.
                                                </p>

                                                <h4>PROJECT INFORMATION</h4>
                                                <p>In this project, I will identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover (backed up by evidence provided by analysis). 
                                                    The business is also interested in learning about any job role specific trends that may exist in the data set. You can also provide 
                                                    any other interesting trends and observations from your analysis. The analysis is backed up by robust experimentation and appropriate 
                                                    visualization.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>There are two goals to this project. First, we want to find factors that lead to attrition and determine monthly income with EDA.
                                                    Secondly , we want to build two prediction models with our chosen factors that can accurately predict both of the variables mentioned
                                                    above. Lastly, we want to use our model to predict the value of these variables on 2 different test datasets. The two models that we 
                                                    found work best are the Naive-Bayes model for attrition and Linear Regression model for salary. We also tried the KNN model. Additionally,
                                                    a video presentation was also made to address our findings.

                                            <p>Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the 
                                                proximity to an east-west railroad. But this Kaggle competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations 
                                                than the number of bedrooms or the presence of a white-picket fence! With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect 
                                                of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home. The entire process will 
                                                be done in R and SAS. SAS is used for the first analysis question and variable selection.

                                            <h4>PROJECT INFORMATION</h4>
                                            <p><strong>Analysis 1:</strong> Century 21 Ames only sells houses in the NAmes, Edwards and BrkSide neighborhoods and would like to simply get 
                                                an estimate of how the SalePrice of the house is related to the square footage of the living area of the house (GrLIvArea) and if the SalesPrice
                                                (and its relationship to square footage) depends on which neighborhood the house is located in. Build and fit a model that will answer this question, 
                                                keeping in mind that realtors prefer to talk about living area in increments of 100 sq. ft. Provide your client with the estimate (or estimates if it v
                                                aries by neighborhood) as well as confidence intervals for any estimate(s).<br>
                                                For this analysis, we also want to create to make an RShiny app that will display at least display a scatterplot of price of the home v. square 
                                                footage (GrLivArea) and allow for the plot to be displayed for at least the NAmes, Edwards and BrkSide neighborhoods separately.
                                            </p>

                                            <p><strong>Analysis 2: </strong> Build the most predictive model for sales prices of homes in all of Ames Iowa. This includes all neighborhoods. 
                                                Your group is limited to only the techniques we have learned in 6371 (no random forests or other methods we have not yet covered). 
                                                Specifically, you should produce 4 models: one from forward selection, one from backwards elimination, one from stepwise selection, and 
                                                one that you build custom. The custom model could be one of the three preceding models or one that you build by adding or subtracting variables 
                                                at your will. Generate an adjusted R-Squared, CV Press and Kaggle Score for each of these models and clearly describe which model you feel is the
                                                best in terms of being able to predict future sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa. We will use all 4 our models to predict the Saleprice on a test 
                                                dataset(test.csv). <br>
                                                In the end, we want to write a 7 page report discussing our findings along with an appendix that includes all of our codes.

                                                    Plot a bar chart to compare.</li>
                                                <li><strong>5.</strong>Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?</li>
                                                <li><strong>6.</strong>Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.</li>
                                                <li><strong>7.</strong>Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  
                                                    Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.</li>
                                                <li><strong>8.</strong>Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other

                                            <p>In this project, we want to create a model that can best predict used car prices. Our team was tasked to identify any relationships between 
                                                the selling prices and the other variables. Our variable selection methodologies includes, but not limited to, forward selection, backward 
                                                selection, stepwise selection, etc. Since this is an observational study our conclusions are limited to the data included in our analysis.

                                                a model where prediction performance is prioritized.  One model should be an attempt at a complex logistic regression model including interaction terms 
                                                or polynomial terms.  One model should be an LDA or QDA.  And the final model should be a nonparametric model such as knn, random forest, classification tree, etc.
